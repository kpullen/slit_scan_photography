# Wut?
This is a small experiment I made in Processing that attempts to demonstrate the [Slit-scan Photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitscan) technique.

# What should I do?
Try letting the camera make one full pass of the screen, and then wobble your head a little. It's pretty cool.

This Processing sketch uses a videofeed from a camera connected to your computer. You probably shouldn't run this if you don't like looking at your mug. The sketch doesn't keep your picture or anything, though.
